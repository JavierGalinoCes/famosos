    <br><h2>Eduardo Mendoza</h2>
    <p>Date of birth: 11 January 1943</p>
    <p>
        He is a spanish writter with a narrative style simple and direct without forgetting to use cultisms, arcaisms like the popular language in his purest expression. He is used to write lonely characters that look wierdly to the society while they fight to survive being out of t.
        <br><br>
        His literary art, that starts with the publication of <em>La verdad sobre el caso Savolta</em> is generally ambiented in his natal city Barcelona, combined with the description of the city in times before spanish civil war and nowadays. Llazzer Moix talks about -bifront reality- when talking about Mendoza's narrative and he stablishes a distintion between his serious or mayor novels, and his amusements and minor novels. But the division between serius and humoristic novels that would correspond with the mayor and minor pointed, dont realize the narrative and estilistic richness of his parodic novels and the humorism present in his serious novels. That's why recent studios mark the seriuosness, criticism and trascendence in his horistic novels and the transversal humorism in his serious or mayor novels, as a result of the parodic effect carasteristic in the posmodern narrative.
        <br><br>
        Even thought his primal literary genre is the novel, Mendoza has written in his professional trayectory a lot of trials like <em>Baroja, la contradicción</em> and more recently stories like <em>Tres vidas de santos</em>. He recieved in 2010 the Planet award for his novel <em>Riña de gatos</em> and in 2016 the Cervantes award.
